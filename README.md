## 🤖 AI Opponent System

The AI uses **Linera Native Oracles** to:

1. **Analyze Game State** - Evaluate health, mana, field position
2. **Query Strategy API** - Call external ML models for optimal moves
3. **Execute Decisions** - Play cards, attack, use counters
4. **Adapt Difficulty** - Adjust based on player skill

---
