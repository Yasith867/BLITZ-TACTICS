---

## 🎮 What Works Right Now

### You Can:
1. ✅ **Play the game** - Start a match vs AI
2. ✅ **Play cards** - Click cards in hand to play them (costs mana)
3. ✅ **Attack** - Click creatures on your field to attack opponent
4. ✅ **End turn** - Click "End Turn" button
5. ✅ **Watch AI play** - AI automatically plays cards and attacks
6. ✅ **Win/Lose** - Game detects victory conditions
7. ✅ **Restart** - Play again after game ends
8. ✅ **View stats** - See mana, health, cards remaining
9. ✅ **Navigate** - Move between Home, Dashboard, Collection pages

### Game Flow:
```
1. Navigate to /game
2. Game starts with 4 cards, 3 mana, 20 health
3. YOUR TURN (5 seconds)
   - Play cards by clicking them
   - Attack by clicking creatures on field
   - Or click "End Turn"
4. OPPONENT TURN (5 seconds)
   - AI automatically plays a card if it can afford one
   - AI attacks with all creatures
5. Repeat until someone reaches 0 health
6. Winner announced
7. Click "Play Again" to restart
```

## 🔄 Integration Status

### Frontend ↔ Backend
- **Current**: Frontend uses mock data
- **Backend Ready**: Smart contracts are implemented
- **Next Step**: Wire Apollo Client to Linera GraphQL endpoint
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Blockchain Deployment
- **Current**: Contracts written in Rust, not deployed
- **Ready For**: Compilation to WASM
- **Next Step**: 
  1. Build with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
  2. Deploy to Linera testnet
  3. Start GraphQL service
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
